# Brief
- Engineered a highly concurrent and available message distribution management platform using the Spring
Cloudframework, capable of handling message delivery to millions of users. The platform provides end-to-end
management of delivery statuses, message content, and system logs.
- Used a microservices architecture, the systemâ€™s module coupling was significantly reduced. Kafka message queues were
used to further enhance system concurrency and enable asynchronous processing. Additionally, the Apollo distributed
configuration center was implemented for efficient configuration management.
